# Proof of stake transactions

The following details the execution of each transaction in the proof of stake system.

## Bonding

`namadac bond --source <source_address> --validator <validator_address> --amount <amount>`

A validator can bond tokens to themselves, or a non-validator account can bond tokens to a validator. In the event of a validator self-bond, no argument is passed to the `--source`. Bonding is still permitted even if the `validator` is jailed.

The bond transaction will only execute if:
- the `amount` is greater than 0
- the `source_address` is a non-validator account that exists on chain
- the `validator_address` is a true validator account
- the `source_address` has enough tokens to bond

Bond execution:

1. Increments the `source-validator` pair's bond at the pipeline epoch.
2. Increments the `validator`'s `total_bonded` at the pipeline epoch.
3. Increments the `validator`'s deltas and total deltas at the pipeline epoch.
4. Updates the validator set at the pipeline epoch if the `validator` is not jailed.
