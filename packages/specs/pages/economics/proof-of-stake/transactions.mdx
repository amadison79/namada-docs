# Proof of stake transactions

The following details the execution of each transaction in the proof of stake system.

## Bonding

Client command:

`namadac bond --source <source_address> --validator <validator_address> --amount <amount>`

A validator can bond tokens to themselves (self-bond), or a non-validator account can bond tokens to a validator (delegation). In the event of a validator self-bond, no argument is passed to the `--source`. Bonding is still permitted even if the `validator` is jailed.

The bond transaction will only execute if:
- the `amount` is greater than 0
- the `source_address` is a non-validator account that exists on chain (if not a self-bond)
- the `validator_address` is a true validator account
- the `source_address` has enough tokens to bond

Bond execution:

1. Increments the `source-validator` pair's `bond` at the pipeline epoch.
2. Increments the `validator_total_bonded` at the pipeline epoch.
3. Increments the `validator`'s deltas and total deltas at the pipeline epoch.
4. Updates the validator set at the pipeline epoch if the `validator` is not jailed.
5. Transfers tokens from the `source` account to the PoS account.

## Unbonding

Client command:

`namadac unbond --source <source_address> --validator <validator_address> --amount <amount>`

An unbond transaction will only execute if:
- the `amount` is greater than 0
- the `source_address` is a non-validator account that exists on chain (if not a self-bond)
- the `validator_address` is a true validator account
- the `validator` is not *frozen* - it does not have any pending slashes yet to be processed
- there are at least `amount` tokens remaining in the bond

When unbonding tokens, the [bonds](../storage.md#bonds), [validator total bonded](../storage.md#validator-total-bonded) and the [delegator redelegated bonds](../storage.mdx#delegator-redelegated-bonds) are decremented in place, starting with the future-most epochs that have tokens. If there are both redelegated and non-redelegated tokens contributing to a bond, then the redelegated tokens are first unbonded before any non-redelegated tokens.

The `unbond_tokens` underlying function that is called during unbonding is also called when redelegating tokens. However, some steps are only executed in the event that it is not a redelegation.

Flow of execution:

1. Find the bond epochs to remove and the bond epoch whose bond amount needs to be modified.
2. Compute the modified redelegated bond if there are any redelegated tokens in the bond that must be modified.
3. Compute new unbond amounts resulting from this unbond call alone.
4. Update (remove and modify) the [bonds](../storage.md#bonds) in storage.
5. **If not a redelegation**, update the [unbonds](../storage.md#unbonds) in storage by incrementing with the new unbonds from step 3.
6. Compute new redelegated unbond amounts resulting from this unbond call alone.
7. Update (remove and modify) the [redelegated bonds](../storage.md#delegator-redelegated-bonds) in storage.
8. **If not a redelegation**, update the [redelegated unbonds](../storage.md#delegator-redelegated-unbonds) in storage by incrementing with the new redelegated unbonds from step 6.
9. Update the [validator total bonded](../storage.md#validator-total-bonded) and [validator total unbonded](../storage.md#validator-total-unbonded) in storage using the new unbonds from step 3.
10. Update the [validator total redelegated bonded](../storage.md#validator-total-redelegated-bonded) and [validator total redlegated unbonded](../storage.md#validator-total-redelegated-unbonded) in storage using the new redelegated unbonds from step 6.
11. Compute the remaining amount in the unbond after applying slashes.
12. **If the validator is not jailed**, update the validator sets.
13. Decrement the `validator_deltas` and `total_deltas` with the slashed unbond amount.

## Withdrawing

Client command:

`namadac withdraw --source <source_address> --validator <validator_address> --amount <amount>`

A withdraw transaction will only execute if:
- an `unbond` exists in storage for the `source-validator` pair.

When this transaction is executed, the tokens within all unbonds and redelegated unbonds that have `withdrawal_epoch` earlier than or equal to the `current_epoch` are withdrawn. Relevant slashes that were discovered after the `unbond` transaction are also applied when computing the correct amount to send the `source` of the withdrawal.

Flow of execution:

1. Find and collect all unbonds with `withdrawal_epoch <= current_epoch` and the corresponding redelegated unbonds, if they exist.
2. Apply slashes to compute the total remaining amount of tokens to return to the `source` from all relevant unbonds.
3. Transfer the final token amount from the `PoS` account to the `source` account.


## Redelegation

Client command:

`namadac redelegate --owner <delegator_address> --src_validator <src_validator_address> --dest_validator <dest_validator_address> --amount <amount>`

A redelegation transaction will only execute if:
- the `delegator_address` is a non-validator account that exists on chain
- the `src_validator_address` and `dest_validator_address` are different validator accounts
- there is not a *chained redelegation*: if the `src_validator_address` is holding any previously redelegated tokens, enough time must have passed such that these tokens cannot be slashed anymore

When executing a redelegation, the protocol will first unbond the token `amount` from the `src_validator_address`, executing the steps described in the [unbonding](#unbonding) section, excluding those that only occur if a redelegation is not occurring. Afterward, the new bond is recorded by applying slashes to the unbonded amount, and other redelegation-related data is updated in storage.

Flow of execution:

1. Unbond the `amount` from the `src_validator_address` by executing the steps described in the [unbonding](#unbonding) section for a redelegation. This function call returns both a total slashed unbond amount and a map of these slashed unbond amounts keyed by the epochs at which they originally contributed to the `src_validator_address`.
2. Increment the `delegator-dest_validator` redelegated bonds and the `dest_validator`'s `total_redelegated_bonded` using the slashed amounts map computed from the unbond call.
3. Increment the `delegator-dest_validator` bond and the `dest_validator`'s `total_bonded` at the pipeline epoch using the total slashed amount from the unbond call.
4. Update the `src_validator`'s `outgoing_redelegations`.
5. Update the `dest_validator`'s `incoming_redelegations`.
6. **If the `dest_validator` is not jailed**, update the validator sets.
7. Increment the `dest_validator`'s deltas and the `total_deltas` with the total slashed amount.

## Initialize validator

Client command:

`namadac init-validator`

TODO: decide what exactly to say

A transaction that can be submitted to instantiate a validator account post-genesis. A successful transaction will initialize the validator account with 0 staked tokens in the PoS system at the pipeline epoch.

A validator initialization transaction will only execute if:
- the provided `commission_rate` and `max_commission_rate_change` are valid
- if provided, the `consensus_key` is an ed25519 key
- if provided, the `eth_cold_key` and `eth_hot_key` are secp256k1 keys
- the `consensus_key` is unique against all other validator `consensus_key`s_

Flow of execution:

1. Initialize the validator account storage with the validator VP, address, some keys with a specified multi-signature threshold.
2. Initialize the validator's PoS data, which includes some more keys, the deltas, the commission rate, and the max commission change.
3. Set the validator state as `BelowThreshold` since it starts with no staked tokens.

## Unjail validator

Client command:

`namadac unjail-validator --validator <validator_address>`

A transaction that can be submitted by a jailed validator to get itself reinstated into the validator set. A successful unjailing transaction will reinsert the validator back into the validator set at the pipeline epoch relative to the epoch of transaction submission.

An unjail transaction will only execute if:
- the validator is jailed for at every epoch from the current one through the pipeline epoch
- the validator is not *frozen* - it does not have any pending slashes yet to be processed

Flow of execution:

1. Update the validator sets at the pipeline epoch according to the stake of the jailed validator at the pipeline epoch.

## Change validator commission rate

Client command:

`namadac change-commission-rate --validator <validator_address> --commission-rate <new_rate>`

A transaction that can be submitted by a validator to change its commission rate for the staking rewards of its delegators. A successful transaction will set the `new_rate` at the pipeline epoch.

A commission rate change transaction will only execute if:
- the `new_rate` is a value between 0 and 1
- the `new_rate` is different from the current rate at the pipeline epoch
- the absolute value difference between `new_rate` and the current rate at the epoch before the pipeline epoch is less than or equal to the validator's `max_commission_rate_change`

Flow of execution:

1. Set the `new_rate` to be the commission rate at the pipeline epoch.
